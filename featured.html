  <h1>Harper</h1>
  <h4>Harper is a two year old 90 pound black lab. She enjoys eating, playing, chewing, and carrying around buckets. She lives a spoiled life in Massachusetts with her family of five. She looks forward to when her owners come home to visit from college.<br>
  She loves getting toys from her Pick of the Pack box, but her favorite pick has been the organic peanut butter flavored treats from the June “Sunshine” box.</h4>

  <h2>This is</h2>
  <h1>Ozzy</h1>
  <h4>Ozzy is a 11 year old 65 pound English Setter. He is constantly running, chasing birds, or curled up taking a nap. He lives in Massachusetts with his black lab sister Harper. He gets excited when his owners come home to visit from college, but at the same time enjoys his options of empty beds to sleep in at night when they are not home.<br>
  Ozzy always loves the organic and locally sourced treats in his Pick of the Pack box, but it is hard to catch him without his Squeaky Dog Plush toy from the April “Man’s Best Friend” themed box. </h4>
  <h5>Ozzy has been a loyal customer and we thank him for his support!</h5>
